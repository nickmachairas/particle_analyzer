Note: This is a tool intended to help scientists analyze particle data more efficiently. One of the possible data sources that has been implemented in this tool is XML files produced by QICPIC, a modular particle size and shape analyser manufactured by Sympatec GmbH (https://www.sympatec.com/). We seek no credit on anything relating to Sympatec. They make great products, call them.
